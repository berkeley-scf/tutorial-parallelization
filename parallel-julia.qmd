## 1 Overview

Julia provides built-in support for various kinds of parallel processing on one or more machines. This material focuses on some standard approaches that are (mostly) analogous to functionality in Python and R. However there is other functionality available, including the ability to control tasks and sending data between processes in a fine-grained way.

In addition to parallelization, the second to last section discusses some issues related to efficiency with for loops, in particular *fused* operations. This is not directly related to parallelization but given the focus on loops in this document, it's useful and interesting to know about.

Finally, the last section discussed offloading computation to the GPU, i.e., massive parallelization on many GPU cores.

## 2 Threading

Threaded calculations are done in parallel on [software threads](./#31-shared-memory).

Threads share objects in memory with the parent process, which is useful for avoiding copies but raises the danger of a "race condition", where different threads modify data that other threads are using and cause errors..

### 2.1 Threaded linear algebra

As with Python and R, Julia uses BLAS, a standard library of basic linear algebra operations (written in
Fortran or C), for linear algebra operations. A fast BLAS can greatly speed up linear algebra relative
to the default BLAS on a machine. Julia uses a fast, open source, free BLAS library called *OpenBLAS*.
In addition to being fast when used on a single core, the openBLAS 
library is  threaded - if your computer has multiple cores and there
are free resources, your linear algebra will use multiple cores

Here's an example.

```{julia}
using LinearAlgebra
using Distributions
n = 7000
x = rand(Uniform(0,1), n,n);

println(BLAS.get_num_threads())
```

```{julia}
function chol_xtx(x)
    z = x'*x   ## z is positive definite
    C = cholesky(z) 
end

BLAS.set_num_threads(4)
@time chol = chol_xtx(x);  
```
```{julia}
BLAS.set_num_threads(1)
@time chol = chol_xtx(x);  
```

We see that using four threads is faster than one, but in this case we don't get a four-fold speedup.

#### Number of threads

By default, Julia will set the number of threads for linear algebra equal to the number of processors on your machine.

As seen above, you can check the number of threads being used with:

```{julia}
BLAS.get_num_threads()
```

Other ways to control the number of threads used for linear algebra include:

  - setting the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable in the shell before starting Julia, and
  - using `BLAS.set_num_threads(n)`.


### 2.2 Threaded for loops

In Julia, you can directly set up [software threads to use for parallel processing](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading).

Here we'll see some examples of running a for loop in parallel, both acting on a single object and used as a parallel map operation.

Here we can operate on a vector in parallel:

```{julia}
using Base.Threads

n = 50000000;
x = rand(n);

@threads for i in 1:length(x)
    x[i] = exp(x[i]) + sin(x[i]);
end
```

We could also threads to carry out a parallel map operation, implemented as a for loop.


```{julia}
n = 1000

function test(n)
    x = rand(Uniform(0,1), n,n)
    z = x'*x 
    C = cholesky(z)
    return(C.U[1,1])
end

a = zeros(12)
@threads for i in 1:12
    a[i] = test(n)
end
```

### 2.3 Spawning tasks on threads

You can also create (aka 'spawn') individual tasks on threads, with the tasks running in parallel.

Let's see an example (taken from [here](http://ferestrepoca.github.io/paradigmas-de-programacion/paralela/tutoriales/julia/notebooks/parallelProgrammingApplications.html) of sorting a vector in parallel, by sorting subsets of the vector in separate threads.

```{julia}

import Base.Threads.@spawn

# sort the elements of `v` in place, from indices `lo` to `hi` inclusive
function psort!(v, lo::Int=1, hi::Int=length(v))
    println(current_task(), ' ', lo, ' ', hi)
    if lo >= hi                       # 1 or 0 elements; nothing to do
        return v
    end
    if hi - lo < 100000               # below some cutoff, run in serial
        sort!(view(v, lo:hi), alg = MergeSort)
        return v
    end

    mid = (lo+hi)>>>1                 # find the midpoint

    ### Set up parallelization here ###

    ## Sort two halves in parallel, one in current call and one in a new task
    ## in a separate thread:
    
    half = @spawn psort!(v, lo, mid)  # task to sort the lower half
    psort!(v, mid+1, hi)              # sort the upper half in the current call
    
    wait(half)                        # wait for the lower half to finish

    temp = v[lo:mid]                  # workspace for merging

    i, k, j = 1, lo, mid+1            # merge the two sorted sub-arrays
    @inbounds while k < j <= hi
        if v[j] < temp[i]
            v[k] = v[j]
            j += 1
        else
            v[k] = temp[i]
            i += 1
        end
        k += 1
    end
    @inbounds while k < j
        v[k] = temp[i]
        k += 1
        i += 1
    end

    return v
end
```

How does this work? Let's consider an example where we sort a vector of length 250000.

The vector gets split into elements 1:125000 (run in task #1) and 125001:250000 (run in the main call). Then the elements 1:125000 are split into 1:62500 (run in task #2) and 62501:125000 (run in task #1), while the elements 125001:250000 are split into 125001:187500 (run in task #3) and 187501:250000 (run in the main call). No more splitting occurs because vectors of length less than 100000 are run in serial.

Assuming we have at least four threads (including the main process), each of the tasks will run in a separate thread, and all four sorts on the vector subsets will run in parallel. 

```{julia}
x = rand(250000);
psort!(x);
```

We see that the output from `current_task()` shows that  the task labels correspond with what I stated above.

The number of tasks running in parallel will be at most the number of threads set in the Julia session.

### 2.4 Controlling the number of threads

You can see the number of threads available:

```{julia}
Threads.nthreads()
```

You can control the number of threads used for threading in Julia (apart from linear algebra) either by:

  - setting the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable in the shell before starting Julia, or
  - starting Julia with the `-t` (or `--threads`) flag, e.g.: `julia -t 4`.

Note that we can't use `OMP_NUM_THREADS` as the Julia threading is not based on openMP.


## 3 Multi-process parallelization

### 3.1 Parallel map operations

We can use `pmap` to run a parallel map operation across multiple Julia processes (on one or more machines).
`pmap` is good for cases where each task takes a non-negligible amount of time, as there is overhead (latency) in starting the tasks.

Here we'll carry out multiple computationally expensive calculations in the map.

We need to import packages and create the function on each of the worker processes using `@everywhere`.

```{julia}
using Distributed

if nprocs() == 1
    addprocs(4)
end

nprocs()
```

```{julia}
@everywhere begin
    using Distributions
    using LinearAlgebra
    function test(n)
        x = rand(Uniform(0,1), n,n)
        z = transpose(x)*x 
        C = cholesky(z)
        return C.U[2,3]
    end
end

result = pmap(test, repeat([5000],12))
```

One can use [static allocation (prescheduling)](./#4-parallelization-strategies) with the `batch_size` argument, thereby assigning that many tasks to each worker to reduce latentcy.

### 3.2 Parallel for loops

One can execute for loops in parallel across multiple worker processes as follows. This is particularly handy for cases where one uses a reduction operator (e.g., the `+` here) so that little data needs to be copied back to the main process. (And in this case we don't copy any data to the workers either.)

Here we'll sum over a large number of random numbers with chunks done on each of the workers, comparing the time to a basic for loop.

```{julia}
function forfun(n)
    sum = 0.0
    for i in 1:n
        sum += rand(1)[1]
    end
    return(sum)
end

function pforfun(n)
   out = @sync @distributed (+) for i = 1:n
       rand(1)[1]
   end
   return(out)
end

n=50000000
@time forfun(n);
```
```{julia}
@time pforfun(n); 
```

The use of `@sync` causes the operation to block until the result is available so we can get the correct timing.

Without a reduction operation, one would generally end up passing a lot of data back to the main process, and this could take a lot of time. For such calculations, one would generally be better off using threaded for loops in order to take advantage of shared memory.

We'd have to look into how the random number seed is set on each worker to better understand any issues that might arise from parallel random number generation, but I believe that each worker has a different seed (but note that this does not explicitly ensure that the random number streams on the workers are distinct, as is the case if one uses the L'Ecuyer algorithm).

### 3.3 Passing data to the workers

With multiple workers, particularly on more than one machine, one generally wants to be careful about having to copy large data objects to each worker, as that could make up a substantial portion of the time involved in the computation.

One can explicitly copy a variable to the workers in an `@everywhere` block by using Julia's interpolation syntax:

```{julia}
@everywhere begin
    x = $x  # copy to workers using interpolation syntax
    println(pointer_from_objref(x), ' ', x[1])  
end
```

We see based on `pointer_from_objref` that each copy of `x` is stored at a distinct location in memory, even when processes are on the same machine.


Also note that if one creates a variable within an `@everywhere` block, that variable is available to all tasks run on the worker, so it is global' with respect to those tasks. Note the repeated values in the result here.

```{julia}
@everywhere begin
    x = rand(5)
    function test(i)
        return sum(x)
    end
end

result = pmap(test, 1:12, batch_size = 3)
```

If one wants to have multiple processes all work on the same object, without copying it, one can consider using Julia's [SharedArray](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/SharedArrays/#SharedArrays.SharedArray) (one machine) or [DArray from the DistributedArrays package](https://juliaparallel.org/DistributedArrays.jl/stable/) (multiple machines) types, which break up arrays into pieces, with different pieces stored locally on different processes.

### 3.4 Spawning tasks

One can use the `Distributed.@spawnat` macro to run tasks on processes, in a fashion similar to using `Threads.@spawn`. More details can be found [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Distributed/#Distributed.@spawnat).

### 3.5 Using multiple machines

In addition to using processes on one machine, one can use processes across multiple machines. One can either start the processes when you start the main Julia session or you can start them from within the Julia session. In both cases you'll need to have the ability to ssh to the other machines without entering your password.

To start the processes when starting Julia, create a "machinefile" that lists the names of the machines and the number of worker processes to start on each machine.

Here's an example machinefile:

```
arwen.berkeley.edu
arwen.berkeley.edu
gandalf.berkeley.edu
gandalf.berkeley.edu
```

Note that if you're using Slurm on a Linux cluster, you could generate that file in the shell from within your Slurm allocation like this:

```
srun hostname > machines
```

Then start Julia like this:

```
julia --machine-file machines
```

From within Julia, you can add processes like this (first we'll remove the existing worker processes started using `addprocs()` previously):

```{julia}
rmprocs(workers())

addprocs([("arwen", 2), ("gandalf", 2)])
```

To check on the number of processes:

```{julia}
nprocs()
```



## 4 Loops and fused operations

Consider the following vectorized code that you might run in a variety of languages (e.g., Julia, Python, R).

```
x = exp(x) + 3*sin(x)
```

If run as vectorized code, this has downsides. First, it will use additional memory (temporary arrays will be created to store `exp(x)`, `sin(x)`, `3*sin(x)`). Second, multiple for loops will have to get executed when the vectorized code is run, looping over the elements of `x` to calculate `exp(x)`, `sin(x)`, etc. (For example in R or Python/numpy, multiple for loops would get run in the underlying C code.)

Contrast that to running directly as a for loop (e.g., in Julia or in C/C++):

```{julia}
#| eval: false
for i in 1:length(x)
    x[i] = exp(x[i]) + 3*sin(x[i])
end
```

Here temporary arrays don't need to be allocated and there is only a single for loop.

Combining loops is called 'fusing' and is an [important optimization that Julia can do](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#More-dots:-Fuse-vectorized-operations). (It's also a [key optimization done by XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla), a compiler used with Tensorflow.)

Of course you might ask why use vectorized code at all given that Julia will [JIT compile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) the for loop above and run it really quickly. That's true, but reading and writing vectorized code is easier than writing for loops.

Let's compare the speed of the following approaches. We'll put everything into functions as generally [recommended when timing Julia code](https://www.juliabloggers.com/timing-in-julia) to avoid [global variables that incur a performance penalty because their type can change](https://julialang.org/blog/2022/08/julia-1.8-highlights/#typed_globals).

First, let's find the time when directly using a for loop, as a baseline.

```{julia}
n = 50000000
y = Array{Float64}(undef, n);
x = rand(n);
```

```{julia}
function direct_for_loop_calc(x, y)
    for i in 1:length(x)
        y[i] = exp(x[i]) + sin(x[i])
    end
end

using BenchmarkTools
@benchmark direct_for_loop_calc(x, y)
```

Notice the lack of additional memory use.

Now let's try a basic vectorized calculation (for which we need the various periods to get vectorization), without fusing. We'll reassign the result to the allocated `y` vector for comparability to the for loop implementation above.

```{julia}
function basic_vectorized_calc(x, y)
     y .= exp.(x) + 3 * sin.(x)
end

using BenchmarkTools
@benchmark basic_vectorized_calc(x, y)
```

The original `x` array is 400 MB; notice the additional memory allocation and that this takes almost twice as long as the original for loop.

Here's a fused version of the vectorized calculation, where the `@.` causes the loops to be fused. 

```{julia}
function fused_vectorized_calc(x, y)
    y .= @. exp(x) + 3 * sin(x)
end

@benchmark fused_vectorized_calc(x, y)
```

We see that the time and (lack of) memory allocation are essentially the same as the original basic for loop.


Finally one can achieve the same fusion by having the function just compute scalar quantities and then using the vectorized version of the function (by using `scalar_calc.()` instead of `scalar_calc()`), which also does the fusion.

```{julia}
function scalar_calc(x)
    return(exp(x) + 3 * sin(x))
end

@benchmark y .= scalar_calc.(x)
```

## 5 Using the GPU

We can use `CUDA.jl` to offload computations to the GPU. Here we'll explore matrix multiplication and vectorized calculations.

There are a couple key things to remember about using a GPU:

 - The GPU memory is separate from CPU memory, and transferring data from the CPU to GPU (or back) is often more costly than doing the computation on the GPU.
    - If possible, generate the data on the GPU or keep the data on the GPU when carrying out a sequence of operations.
 - By default GPU calculations are often doing using 32-bit (4-byte) floating point numbers rather than the standard of 64-bit (8-byte) when on the CPU.
    - This can affect speed comparisons between CPU and GPU.

Note that for this section, I'm pasting in the output when running the code separately on a machine with a GPU because this document is generated on a machine without a GPU.

### 5.1 Matrix multiplication

Let's first consider basic matrix multiplication. In this case since we generate the matrices on the CPU, they are 64-bit.

```{julia}
using BenchmarkTools
using CUDA
using LinearAlgebra

function matmult(x, y)
    z = x * y
    return z
end

m = 7000

x = randn(m, m);
y = randn(m, m);
x_gpu = CuArray(x);
y_gpu = CuArray(y);

## These use 64-bit numbers:
typeof(x)
# Matrix{Float64} (alias for Array{Float64, 2})
typeof(x_gpu)
# CuArray{Float64, 2, CUDA.Mem.DeviceBuffer}

LinearAlgebra.BLAS.set_num_threads(1);

@benchmark z = matmult(x, y) 
# BenchmarkTools.Trial: 1 sample with 1 evaluation.
#  Single result which took 17.271 s (0.00% GC) to evaluate,
#  with a memory estimate of 373.84 MiB, over 2 allocations.

@benchmark CUDA.@sync z_gpu = matmult(x_gpu, y_gpu)
BenchmarkTools.Trial: 65 samples with 1 evaluation.
 Range (min … max):  53.172 ms … 90.679 ms  ┊ GC (min … max): 0.00% … 0.00%
 Time  (median):     76.419 ms              ┊ GC (median):    0.00%
 Time  (mean ± σ):   77.404 ms ±  4.092 ms  ┊ GC (mean ± σ):  0.00% ± 0.00%
```

Clearly the the GPU calculation is much faster, taking about 75 milliseconds.

Let's compare that to the time of copying the data to the GPU:

```{julia}
@benchmark CUDA.@sync tmp = CuArray(x)
# BenchmarkTools.Trial: 59 samples with 1 evaluation.
#  Range (min … max):  83.766 ms … 137.849 ms  ┊ GC (min … max): 0.00% … 0.00%
#  Time  (median):     84.684 ms               ┊ GC (median):    0.00%
#  Time  (mean ± σ):   85.696 ms ±   7.011 ms  ┊ GC (mean ± σ):  0.00% ± 0.00%
```

This suggests that the time in copying the data is similar to that for doing the
computation.

If we count the time of transferring the data to and from the GPU, that ends up being a substantial part of the time, compared to the 75 ms for simply doing the matrix multiplication.

```{julia}
function matmult_with_transfer(x, y)
    xc = CuArray(x)
    yc = CuArray(y)
    z = xc * yc
    return Array(z)
end

@benchmark CUDA.@sync z = matmult_with_transfer(x, y) 
# BenchmarkTools.Trial: 20 samples with 1 evaluation.
#  Range (min … max):  251.578 ms … 258.017 ms  ┊ GC (min … max): 0.00% … 0.57%
#  Time  (median):     253.886 ms               ┊ GC (median):    0.00%
#  Time  (mean ± σ):   254.228 ms ±   1.708 ms  ┊ GC (mean ± σ):  4.33% ± 6.78%
```


As a sidenote, we can force use of 64-bit numbers on the GPU (in this case when generating values on the GPU) like this.

```{julia}
x_gpu = CUDA.randn(Float64, m, m);
```

Finally, let's consider whether the matrix multiplication is faster using 32-bit numbers.

```{julia}
x = randn(Float32, m, m);
y = randn(Float32, m, m);
x_gpu = CuArray(x);
y_gpu = CuArray(y);
typeof(x_gpu)

@benchmark z = matmult(x, y) 
# BenchmarkTools.Trial: 1 sample with 1 evaluation.
#  Single result which took 8.671 s (0.00% GC) to evaluate,
@benchmark CUDA.@sync z_gpu = matmult(x_gpu, y_gpu)
# BenchmarkTools.Trial: 91 samples with 1 evaluation.
#  Range (min … max):  41.174 ms … 70.491 ms  ┊ GC (min … max): 0.00% … 0.00%
#  Time  (median):     54.420 ms              ┊ GC (median):    0.00%
#  Time  (mean ± σ):   55.363 ms ±  2.912 ms  ┊ GC (mean ± σ):  0.00% ± 0.00%
```

So that's faster, though I'm not sure why the CPU implementation is about twice as fast (which makes sense in that it is working with numbers taking up half as much space) while the GPU implementation does not achieve that speedup.

### 5.2 Vectorized calculations

Here we'll consider using the GPU for vectorized calculations, noting that [earlier](./#4-loops-and-fused-operations) we talked about using `.` to vectorize and `@` to fuse loops in the context of CPU-based calculations.

```{julia}
# Scalar function to do something.
function myfun(x)
    y = exp(x) + 3 * sin(x)
    return y
end

# Vectorized version that modified `y` in place.
function myfun_vec(x, y)
    y .= myfun.(x)
    return 
end

n = 250000000; # 50000000;
y = Vector{Float64}(undef, n);
x = rand(n);

x_gpu = CuArray(x);
y_gpu = CuArray(y);

@benchmark myfun_vec(x, y)   # 3.5 sec.

@benchmark CUDA.@sync myfun_vec(x_gpu, y_gpu)  # 6 ms.
```

Of course, as in the matrix multiplication example above, if you need to copy the data to and from the GPU, that will add substantial time.
